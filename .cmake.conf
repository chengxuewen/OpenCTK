# Policy settings for commands defined by OpenCTK. These will also be injected into the top level policy scope of each OpenCTK
# module when building OpenCTK so that modules have the same policy settings as OpenCTK by default.
# They can be overridden by individual OpenCTK modules in their own .cmake.conf files if needed.
#
# NOTE: These two values are also hard-coded in OCTKBuildInternalsConfig.cmake because that file is used in-place by a
#       superbuild, so there is no opportunity for substituting the values from here. Keep both locations in sync.
