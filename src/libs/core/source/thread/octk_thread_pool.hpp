 * @brief The ThreadPool class manages a collection of threads.
 * @{
 * @details
 * ThreadPool manages and recyles individual std::thread to help reduce thread creation costs in programs that
 * use threads. Each OpenCTK application has one global ThreadPool object, which can be accessed by calling
 * ThreadPool::instance().
 *
 * To use one of the ThreadPool threads, subclass ThreadPool::Task and implement the run() virtual function.
 * Then create an object of that class and pass it to ThreadPool::start().
 *
 * ThreadPool deletes the ThreadPool::Task automatically by param autoDelete is true.
 *
 * ThreadPool supports executing the same ThreadPool::Task more than once by calling tryStartNow(this) from
 * within ThreadPool::Task::run().
 * If autoDelete is enabled the ThreadPool::Task will be deleted when the last thread exits the run function.
 * Calling start() multiple times with the same ThreadPool::Task when autoDelete is enabled creates a race
 * condition and is not recommended.
 *
 * Threads that are unused for a certain amount of time will expire.
 * The default expiry timeout is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
 * This can be changed using setExpiryTimeout().
 * Setting a negative expiry timeout disables the expiry mechanism.
 *
 * Call maxThreadCount() to query the maximum number of threads to be used.
 * If needed, you can change the limit with setMaxThreadCount().
 * The default maxThreadCount() is ThreadPool::idealThreadCount().
 * The activeThreadCount() function returns the number of threads currently doing work.
 *
 * The reserveThread() function reserves a thread for external use.
 * Use releaseThread() when your are done with the thread, so that it may be reused.
 * Essentially, these functions temporarily increase or reduce the active thread count and are useful when
 * implementing time-consuming operations that are not visible to the ThreadPool.
 *
 * Note that ThreadPool is a low-level class for managing threads,
 * see the OpenCTK Concurrent module for higher level alternatives.
