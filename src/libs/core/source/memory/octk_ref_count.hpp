// Refcounted objects should implement the following informal interface:
//
// void AddRef() const ;
// RefCountReleaseStatus Release() const;
//
// You may access members of a reference-counted object, including the AddRef()
// and Release() methods, only if you already own a reference to it, or if
// you're borrowing someone else's reference. (A newly created object is a
// special case: the reference count is zero on construction, and the code that
// creates the object should immediately call AddRef(), bringing the reference
// count from zero to one, e.g., by constructing an ScopedRefPtr).
//
// AddRef() creates a new reference to the object.
//
// Release() releases a reference to the object; the caller now has one less
// reference than before the call. Returns kDroppedLastRef if the number of
// references dropped to zero because of this (in which case the object destroys
// itself). Otherwise, returns kOtherRefsRemained, to signal that at the precise
// time the caller's reference was dropped, other references still remained (but
// if other threads own references, this may of course have changed by the time
// Release() returns).
//
// The caller of Release() must treat it in the same way as a delete operation:
// Regardless of the return value from Release(), the caller mustn't access the
// object. The object might still be alive, due to references held by other
// users of the object, but the object can go away at any time, e.g., as the
// result of another thread calling Release().
//
// Calling AddRef() and Release() manually is discouraged. It's recommended to
// use ScopedRefPtr to manage all pointers to reference counted objects.
// Note that ScopedRefPtr depends on compile-time duck-typing; formally
// implementing the below RefCountInterface is not required.
