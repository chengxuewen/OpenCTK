// This class is a thin wrapper around FILE*. It's main features are that it
// owns the FILE*, calling fclose on destruction, and that on windows, file
// names passed to the open methods are always treated as utf-8, regardless of
// system code page.

// Most of the methods return only a success/fail indication. When needed, an
// optional argument |int* error| should be added to all methods, in the same
// way as for the OpenWriteOnly methods.

    // Opens a file, in read or write mode. Use the is_open() method on the
    // returned object to check if the open operation was successful. On failure,
    // and if `error` is non-null, the system errno value is stored at |*error|.
    // The file is closed by the destructor.
