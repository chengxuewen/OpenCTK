 * @brief The ElapsedTimer class provides a fast way to calculate elapsed times.
 * @{
 * @details
 * The ElapsedTimer class is usually used to quickly calculate how much time has elapsed between two events.
 * ElapsedTimer tries to use monotonic clocks if possible.
 * This means it's not possible to convert ElapsedTimer objects to a human-readable time.
 *
 * The typical use-case for the class is to determine how much time was spent in a slow operation.
 * The simplest example of such a case is for debugging purposes, as in the following example:
